Hi, I’m Cem! I’m a software developer specializing in backend development, with a focus on Java and Spring Boot, and I’ve recently been exploring Kotlin with growing interest.

I created this blog to share my experiences, insights, and lessons learned in software development, and to keep some of my personal notes.

Here, you’ll find articles on Java, and of course Kotlin, architecture, algorithms, and software best practices, along with occasional posts on tools, techniques, and industry trends.
